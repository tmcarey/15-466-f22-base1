# Overhead!

Author: Thomas Carey

Design: All game assets are derived from 2 large tilemaps which can be swapped out at will. The game automatically derives pallettes from the tilemap, and can build large animated groups of sprites.

How Your Asset Pipeline Works:

(TODO: describe the steps in your asset pipeline, from source files to tiles/backgrounds/whatever you upload to the PPU466.)

(TODO: make sure the source files you drew are included. You can [link](your/file.png) to them to be a bit fancier.)

How To Play:

Menu:
WASD to change menu selection, SPACE to select.

WASD to fly in a particular direction, SPACE to shoot.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
